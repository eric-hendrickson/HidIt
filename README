HidIt v. 0.2

Purpose:  Allows the user to click on a word within a <p> element in HTML and
          make that word invisible. Secondarily, if the user hovers the mouse
          over that word while it's invisible, they can see the word.

How it Works: Javascript function takes every word separated by a space within
              any <h1-6>, <p>, or <li> element and creates a <span> for each
              word separated by spaces.

Issues:   No way to turn this functionality off when hitting the plugin icon.
          Links and other embedded elements are destroyed when spans are
          created. Will continue to find ways to get this to work with other
          tags.
