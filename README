HidIt v. 0.1.1

Purpose:  Allows the user to click on a word within a <p> element in HTML and
          make that word invisible. Secondarily, if the user hovers the mouse
          over that word while it's invisible, they can see the word.

How it Works: Javascript function takes every word separated by a space within
              any <p> element and creates a <span> for each word separated by
              spaces.

Issues:   No way to turn this functionality off when hitting the plugin icon.
          Links and other embedded elements are destroyed when spans are
          created.
