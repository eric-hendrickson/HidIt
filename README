HidIt v. 0.2.1

Purpose:  Allows the user to click on a word within a <p> element in HTML and
          make that word invisible. Secondarily, if the user hovers the mouse
          over that word while it's invisible, they can see the word.

How it Works: Javascript function takes every word separated by a space within
              any <h1-6>, <p>, <li>, or <td> element and creates a <span> for
              each word separated by spaces or periods.

How to Enable:  Go to Extensions in Chrome. Check the box that says "Developer
                Mode". Then, click the button "Load unpacked extension". When
                you update the plugin via GitHub, click "Reload (Ctrl + R)" or
                press Ctrl + R.

Issues:   No way to turn this functionality off when hitting the plugin icon.
          Links and other embedded text elements, as well as some navigation
          bars, are no longer destroyed, but spans are made inside them. the
          whole thing is slow on very large or complex pages. Will continue to
          find ways to get this to work with other tags.
